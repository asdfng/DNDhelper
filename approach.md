[06/23/23-17:49] Log Initialized
[06/23/23-17:49] I'm going to start by making the system local, but in the future I'd like to connect it to a discord bot
[06/23/23-17:51] So a few things to consider before working on code, what am I trying to accomplish?
[06/23/23-17:52] I was to this program to track a few things -> buffs/debuffs, health, rounds
[06/23/23-17:53] for buffs/debuffs -> who has it, and for how long
[06/23/23-17:54]  I'll need to be able to define, who the buff is on and how long it will be active for
[06/23/23-17:58] Aside: I'll also need a way to store session information and launch at a later date
[06/23/23-18:01] Making the buff document I should make the character class
[06/23/23-18:02] first things first, I should work on a wireframe for the terminal interface
[06/23/23-18:02] Then I can thing about how the code will look
[06/23/23-18:50] I've got a good idea of what I want the screens to look like for now so I start making those first
[06/23/23-19:32] Added the basic outline for the main screen but I'd like to add some more stuff for making it look pretty
